# Materialize Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate project to get you kick started with materialize, grunt and Sass.

Note: Before you get started you will need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJs</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Bash</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">Grunt CLI</a>.

1. To get started, download/clone the repository using the above URL by opening Git Bash in the directory you would like to install it.
2. Type "npm install". This will install all the required dependencies using the package.json file 
3. When all of that is installed, you can run the commands "grunt" or "grunt build". The build on minimizes all the css and javascript.
